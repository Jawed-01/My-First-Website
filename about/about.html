        <h1> ABOUT</H1>
        <P> An <strong>electric bike</strong> (e-bike) is a modern vehicle that runs on an <em>electric motor</em>  by a<strong> rechargeable battery </strong>instead of fuel like petrol or diesel. It is designed to provide people with a <em> cheaper, cleaner,</em> and more efficient way of transportation. The main reason why electric bikes are becoming popular is that they are cost-effective; charging the battery is very affordable compared to buying fuel every day. In addition, electric bikes are very <strong> low-maintenance</strong> because they do not need engine oil, fuel filters, or frequent servicing, which saves both time and money for the user. Another important feature of e-bikes is that they are<strong> environmentally friendly.</strong> They produce<strong> no harmful smoke or gases,</strongs> which helps reduce air pollution and makes the air safer to breathe. They are also much quieter than traditional bikes, which means they help reduce noise pollution in busy cities. Electric bikes are very easy to charge at home, at the office, or at charging stations, and many models can travel up to <strong>  60–100 kilometers</strong> on a single charge, depending on the battery power. Because of these benefits, they are becoming highly popular among students, professionals, and daily commuters who want an affordable and comfortable travel option. Many governments around the world are also promoting electric bikes by offering subsidies, discounts, and charging facilities to encourage people to shift from fuel-based vehicles to electric ones. With <em><strong> rising petrol prices</strong></em> and increasing awareness about global warming and pollution, electric bikes are seen as the future of transportation. They save money, protect the environment, and provide a modern, sustainable, and <strong >smart solution </strong> daily travel, which is why more and more people are choosing them every day"
