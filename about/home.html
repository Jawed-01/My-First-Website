<h1>ELECTRIC BIKE</h1>
<p>An electric bike (e-bike) is a modern vehicle that runs on an electric motor instead of fuel. It uses a rechargeable battery that makes riding smooth, fast, and eco-friendly. E-bikes are cheaper to maintain than petrol bikes because they donâ€™t need fuel, oil, or frequent servicing. They are also environmentally friendly as they produce no smoke or harmful gases. Many people prefer electric bikes for daily travel because they save money, reduce noise pollution, and are easy to charge at home. With rising fuel prices, e-bikes are becoming a smart and sustainable choice for the future.</p>
